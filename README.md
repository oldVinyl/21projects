21 beginner projects, i think....mostly JavaScript

## 1. To-do
**Level:**
- Beginner (Easy)

**Comments:**
- To be honestly honest, i nearly gave up on something that is supposed to be easy when i realized that i didnt know how to implement the delete button. But i didnt. And inevitable, eventually, i figured it out!

**Bugs to fix:**
- *Update list after add/delete without reloading everything bc it removes the checked properties
- *When the array is empty, the last deleted element stays...why?
- *Unaligned display!
- *CSS and styling
- *There has to be a more efficient way to implement the delete button...but for now, im proud of my work :>
